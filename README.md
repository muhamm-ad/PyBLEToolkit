# PyBLEToolkit

PyBLEToolkit is a Python toolkit designed to provide a generic environment for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) services using tkinter. This toolkit simplifies the development of custom BLE service interfaces, enabling developers to focus on functionality and data handling while easily integrating with a GUI framework.

## Features

- **Easy GUI Integration**: Quickly add custom frames to display and interact with BLE services.
- **Python and Tkinter Based**: Utilizes Python for logic and tkinter for a user-friendly interface.
- **Extensible Framework**: Designed to be flexible, allowing developers to implement and showcase their BLE services seamlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or newer
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

To set up PyBLEToolkit on your local machine, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/muhamm-ad/PyBLEToolkit.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd PyBLEToolkit

# Install necessary Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installation, you can start by creating a new BLE service frame. Here is a simple example of how to integrate a new service into the toolkit:

```python
# Example Python script to demonstrate usage
from PyBLEToolkit import BLEService

# Implement your BLE service logic
class MyBLEService(BLEService):
    def display_data(self, data):
        # Logic to display data in GUI
        print(data)
```
